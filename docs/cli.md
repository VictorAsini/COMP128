## CLI Commands

ls (List): This command lists the contents of a directory. When you run ls, it shows the files and directories in the current working directory by default. You can also specify a different directory or use options like -l for detailed listings or -a to show hidden files

cat (Concatenate): This command is used to display the contents of a file. It reads the file and prints its content to the terminal. It's also useful for combining (concatenating) multiple files into one.
